 <p>Hello Readers,
  This post is going to be about me and my learning of the mini lesson that I learned. The mini lesson that i learned was Reactive System, Data Science, and Internet.Reactive System are computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. Data Science is analysis scripts.Usually in Python, and sometimes presented nicely in markdown or Python Notebooks with a mix of code, commentary and graphs The output is insights, though sometimes are also data scientists, deciding how to improve a system or model. And for Internet well already should know. We are using it now. </p>  
  
<p>The internet. We all used it on a day to day bases so do I. I use the internet everyday especially in school. My school invole the internet all the time. Without the internet there wouldnt be no such thing as pyret,java,html and etc, because everthing you are on sracth that everthing around you involes the internet.</p>

<p> 
Well goodbye my readers, Come back next week for the new update.
