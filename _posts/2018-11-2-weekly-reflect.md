 <p> Hello Readers 
 This week we learned about defining function and contracts. I really didn't get to get a full understanding of functions and contracts as I should because of my absent at school lately.  </p>

<p> 
My understanding of a is that a function is a unit of code that is often defined by its role within a greater code structure. Specifically, a function contains a unit of code that works on various inputs, many of which are variables, and produces concrete results involving changes to variable values or actual operations based on the inputs. And my understanding  Contracts are a breakthrough technique to reduce the programming effort for large projects. Contracts are the concept of preconditions, postconditions, errors, and invariants.

<p> 
Well goodbye my readers, I wish I was able to explain more unfortunately cant. Come back next week for the new update.
