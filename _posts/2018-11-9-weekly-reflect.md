Hello Readers, So today I took a test learning why contracts and function are important. Well, let me tell you that I was lost during the whole test. I felt so dumb after my teacher explains why contracts and function are important.
Function are important because they are units of code that works on various inputs, many of which are variables, and produces concrete results involving changes to variable values or actual operations based on the inputs. And this is where contracts come in. To check if you're in a working function you need to check it first.Just like you are doing math homework. Contracts are a breakthrough technique to reduce the programming effort for large projects. Contracts are the concept of preconditions, postconditions, errors, and invariants. Now explain what function and contract are you should understand why function s=adn contracts are important.
