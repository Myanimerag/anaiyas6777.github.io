<p>This week post will be about how we made a flag using Pryet.<em>Pyret is a programming language designed to serve as an outstanding choice for programming education while exploring the confluence of scripting and functional programming. It's under active design and development, and free to use or modify.</em> Using Pryet was a little challenging as I first started. But after a while i statred to get used to it. But ehough with the Pryet lets talk about THE FLAG PROJECT  </p> 

<p> On October 4th we started on the flag Project. We had to choose the flag we whanted to create.At first I i didnt know what I whanted to do so I thought of something important to me. Which was the Korea Flag but I realize I wasnt ready for the flag , so i decide to do the Japan Flag, But before we was allow we had to make a construction of the flag. This is example of my flag
