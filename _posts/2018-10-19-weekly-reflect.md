<p class="italic">This is a paragraph in italic style.</p>>This week post will be about how we made a flag using Pryet.<em>Pyret is a programming language designed to serve as an outstanding choice for programming education while exploring the confluence of scripting and functional programming. It's under active design and development, and free to use or modify.</em> Using Pryet was a little challenging as I first started. But after a while i statred to get used to it. But ehough with the Pryet lets talk about THE FLAG PROJRCT  </p> 

<p class="italic">This is a paragraph in italic style.</p>> On October 4th we started on the flag Project. We had to choose the flag we whanted to create.At first I i didnt know what I whanted to do so I thought of something important to me. Which was the Korea Flag but I relize I was ready for thr flag , so i decide to do the Japan Flag. That wasnt that challenging TO BE HONEST</p>
