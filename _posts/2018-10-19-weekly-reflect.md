<p>This week post will be about how we made a flag using Pryet.<em>Pyret is a programming language designed to serve as an outstanding choice for programming education while exploring the confluence of scripting and functional programming. It's under active design and development, and free to use or modify.</em> Using Pryet was a little challenging as I first started. But after a while i statred to get used to it. But ehough with the Pryet lets talk about THE FLAG PROJECT  </p> 

<p> On October 4th we started on the Flag Project. We had to choose the flag we whanted to create.At first I i didnt know what I whanted to do so I thought of something important to me. Which was the Korea Flag but I realize I wasnt ready for the flag , so i decide to do the Japan Flag, But before we was allow we had to make a construction of the flag. This is the construction of my flag.

<p>After October 4th we didnt start back on are the Flag Project until October 20th. On that day we learned how to apply contracts to slove problems. The contracts we learned was circle,triangles,square,and retangle.As we learned the name of the contracts we had to define them as well. Such as circle (radius= NUMBER, style= STRING, color= STRING). With this define we learned how to make a solid circle with any color are choice.

<p>After we practice makeing differnt shapes. On October 18th we finally finish are flags.The flag I started to make was the Japan Flag, all though the flag looked simple to make it wasnt that easy. I had to learned the background of the japan flag.This the coding that i used.include image 
#JAPAN FLAG
RW=rectangle(300,200,"outline","black")
RC=circle((200 * 3/5) / 2 ,"solid","red")

place-image(RC, 300/2 , 200/2 , RW),and I the bottom is the finish piece.</p>
